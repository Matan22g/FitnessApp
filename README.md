<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
  My first attempt to create a mobile app using only python, I wanted to create an app to help me keep track of my gym sessions, show me statistics and graphs, with the least hustle and effort, and with top quality and design.
  I've edited some of the KivyMd uix files to make them fit my app needs, most of the edited files are in customKv folder.
